Miette is a "small sweet thing" in french

In another way, Miette is light-weight low memory usage library for 
reading and, maybe converting (in future) Microsoft Office documents.

See src/miette.py for usage examples

In tests/* directory you find some examples:
- mw_* - generated by Microsoft Word
- oo_* - generated by OpenOffice
- gd_* - generated by Google Docs
- te_* - generated by TextEdit (Mac OS X)
- *_lorem_ipsum - text from http://www.lipsum.com/ (150 paragraphs)
- *_vesna_yandex_ru - text from http://vesna.yandex.ru/ (any 3 subjects)
You can submit more example documents, generated by this and other programs and services. Please, send info about your system (Windows/Macintosh/Linux/BSD/...) and your document generator (OpenOffice/Microsoft Office/...) with version numbers. Thanks a lot.
